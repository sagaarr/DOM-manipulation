The innerText property sets or returns the text content of the specified node, and all its descendants.

If you set the innerText property, any child nodes are removed and replaced by a single Text node containing the specified string.

Note: This property is similar to the textContent property, however there are some differences:

textContent returns the text content of all elements, while innerText returns the content of all elements, except for <script> and <style> elements.
